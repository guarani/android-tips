    Find the location of your Android SDK by opening Android Studio -> SDK
    Manager and noting the value of SDK Path.
    (e.g. /Users/paulvonschrottky/adt/sdk)

    Type 
        ~/adt/sdk/tools/android list targets
    and note the target id of the highest version.

    Execute the following to create a project in the current directory (we're
    using a target id of 1).
        ~/adt/sdk/tools/android create project --target 1 --name MyFirstApp \
        --path ./MyFirstApp --activity MyActivity \
        --package com.example.myfirstapp

    Do one of the following options
        a) Running The App In The Emulator
           
           1) Type
                  ~/adt/sdk/tools/android avd
              to open the emulator (AVD) manager.
           
           2) Create a new device by following the on-screen prompts. Then
              select the device from the list and click Start to start the 
              device.
           
           3) In the root of the Android project, type
                  ant debug
              to compile the app.
           
           4) In the root directory of the Android project, type
                  ~/adt/sdk/platform-tools/adb install bin/MyFirstApp-debug.apk
              to run the app in the emulator.

           Note: If the installation fails with
               Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_ALREADY_EXISTS]
           that's because the app is already installed. To replace the existing
           app, use the -r option on the adb install command, like this
               ~/adt/sdk/platform-tools/adb install -r bin/MyFirstApp-debug.apk

        b) Running The App On A Real Device
           
           1) Connect the device to the Mac via USB. If on an older device,
              enable development on the device by going to Settings -> 
              Applications -> Development and enable USB Debugging. If using a
              newer device, try going to Setting -> About Phone and tap Build 
              Number 7 times, then go to the previous screen to find the
              developer options.
           2) Perform steps 3) and 4) from option a) above.
